# bilateral-filter

Bilateral filter implemented in Python 3.6, using the OpenCV and Numpy library

Running Requirements:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* OpenCV 3.4.5.20 or higher
* Numpy 1.15.4 or higher

Items Specification:

* `input` folder contains the source images
* `output` folder contains a set of filtered images of source images
* `report.pdf` is the report of this coursework
* `main.py` is the main entrance of the program, which contains a series of testing code that can filter source images to filtered images

To Run the Program:

make sure all required modules above are installed correctly, and run `main.py` from command line or as other Python programs. Then, the testing code will generate a set of filtered images of source images in `output` folder
e.g.
    $ python main.py

More information about the implementation can be found in `report.pdf` and comments of source code
